# Nintendo eShop Integration

This integration cannot access your Nintendo account; therefore, you must specify which titles you own. Details for owned titles will be retrieved from the Nintendo eShop.

You must also specify your region code. Currently, only Europe (EU) and Japan (JP) region codes are supported.
