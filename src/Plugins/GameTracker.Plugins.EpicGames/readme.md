# Epic Games Store Integration

This integration cannot access your Epic account; therefore, you must specify which titles you own. Details for owned titles will be retrieved from the Epic Games store.

**Note:** Due to API limitations, not all titles support deep linking to the Epic Games Launcher. If this is not possible for a given title, you will be directed to the title's store page instead.
